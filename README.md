Hello everyone.

I've developed a chatbot utilizing RAG technology. This chatbot extracts information from provided PDFs, 
breaks them down into smaller segments, and then analyzes each segment. It categorizes the content based on its analysis. 
When a question is asked, the chatbot identifies the four most relevant segments and interprets the question by analyzing these passages.
